# Mental-Health-project
World Mental Health Day on October 10 raises awareness and mobilizes efforts for global mental health, uniting stakeholders.

October 10 marks World Mental Health Day, aimed at increasing global awareness of mental health issues and encouraging support for mental health initiatives. This day allows all stakeholders involved in mental health to discuss their efforts and highlight what actions are needed to ensure mental health care is accessible for everyone worldwide.

This project has been done during my course of Data Analyst @ Masterschool.
Consists of: 
  1. Marketing campaign Budget Allocation.

       The starting point is a dataset from the Global Burden of Disease Study (2019). As described on their website:

         'The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study provides a comprehensive picture of mortality and disability across countries, time, age, and sex. It quantifies health             loss from hundreds of diseases, injuries, and risk factors, so that health systems can be improved and disparities eliminated.'

       The dataset covers 204 countries and includes the estimated number and percentage of people who are diagnosed with mental disorders, broken down by demographics                segments.

       In order to allocate fairly the budget, we focused on groups with a higher incidence of mental health conditions.
      
       Spreadsheets were utilized for our analysis. File Attached in this project.
