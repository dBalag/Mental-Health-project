# Mental-Health-project
World Mental Health Day on October 10 raises awareness and mobilizes efforts for global mental health, uniting stakeholders.

October 10 marks World Mental Health Day, aimed at increasing global awareness of mental health issues and encouraging support for mental health initiatives. This day allows all stakeholders involved in mental health to discuss their efforts and highlight what actions are needed to ensure mental health care is accessible for everyone worldwide.

This project has been done during my course of Data Analyst @ Masterschool.
Consists of: 

  1. Marketing campaign Budget Allocation.

       The starting point is a dataset from the Global Burden of Disease Study (2019). As described on their website:

         'The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study provides a comprehensive picture of mortality and disability across countries, time, age, and sex. It quantifies health             loss from hundreds of diseases, injuries, and risk factors, so that health systems can be improved and disparities eliminated.'

       The dataset covers 204 countries and includes the estimated number and percentage of people who are diagnosed with mental disorders, broken down by demographics              segments.

       In order to allocate fairly the budget, we focused on groups with a higher incidence of mental health conditions.
      
       Spreadsheets were utilized for our analysis. 

       To grasp the overall prevalence of mental health conditions among various demographic groups, we examined prevalence data by age and gender.

       It is estimated that 970 million people globally, which accounts for 13% of the world population, suffer from a mental disorder.

       Adults aged 20-54 are the most impacted by mental health conditions, both in terms of total numbers and percentage prevalence. They represent the largest segment of          individuals with mental disorders globally. While they have the highest diagnosis rates, the difference is only marginal compared to teenagers (10-19 years old) and          seniors (55+ years old).

       Females are marginally more likely than males to receive a mental health diagnosis, with 13.53% of females compared to 12.54% of males. When analyzed by age groups,          this difference becomes more pronounced among adults and seniors, where 15.3-15.8% of females are diagnosed compared to 12.7%-13.7% of males. Conversely, among               children and teenagers, males have a ~2% higher diagnosis rate than females. Overall, mental health prevalence is significantly lower in children than in adults.

       To maximize budget efficiency and minimize the creation of excess ads, we conducted a Pareto Analysis. This analysis focused on the number of individuals diagnosed           with a mental disorder across different country, age, and sex segments.
     
       To cover 80% of the estimated total number of people diagnosed with a mental disorder, we need to focus on just 165 segments (out of 1200 different segments).
